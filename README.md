### Target environment (windows, linux, ios, web, etc.)
Android is the target environment; it will be an app.

### Why are we doing this... 
People spend lots of time searching for a  particular clothing item or choosing from massive bulk. Oftentimes it’s not due to the lack of clothes, but rather the fact that the clothes are unorganized and hidden in a closet or storage space. Most people have lots of clothes, but cannot keep track of them. Wardrobe Assistant helps in those moments when frustration kicks in because the perfect outfit eludes them. Wardrobe Assistant would allow users to scroll through their clothes and see what they have. They can see what looks good together in a matter of minutes: saving both time and the user’s sanity. The clothes are assigned a location in the wardrobe,  allowing the user to find the perfect outfit for the right occasion. Team members also want to become more familiar with android programming. It will be challenging and we will get an opportunity to expand our knowledge of mobile applications.
